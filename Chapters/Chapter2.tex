In this chapter we present some of the tools which had a big impact in the field of bioinformatics, and especially metagenomics. Even though we focus on abundance estimation techniques, we provide an overview of the most important methods for the assignment of reads, both based on alignments and on $k$-mer composition, since their properties highly influenced the solutions adopted for the actual estimation of abundances. This list is not nearly extensive, and we refer to \textbf{[ref karel]} for a more detailed overview, especially for read assignment.
